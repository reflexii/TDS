Ataxia Espionage is the last game project I was part of in Tampere University of Applied Sciences. It is a 2D top-down action shooter game heavily inspired by Hotline Miami. The game was created using Unity and it was coded with C#. The game was made in a two-man group, where my friend handled the graphical/artistic side of development while I focused on all coding related things.

There was lots of different coding work for me in this project. Most of the crucial mechanics for the game were quite easy to implement, however stuff like pathfinding took some research to do properly. We used A* Pathfinding for the AI-opponents and making them look and feel natural was both interesting and difficult. The biggest learning experience in this project was definitely A* Pathfinding. The second biggest learning experience was actually related to testing and release of the game. In the past game projects we didn't really have enough time to properly test the game due to time restraints. During the first talks with my friend we made it very clear that we want to keep the scope of the game lower than in the past so we would get enough time to fix issues and locate bugs. We managed to release the game in time and without any major bugs, which felt amazing.

This project really demonstrates my coding skills the best. There is lots of different things to code as a solo coder so I have become pretty versatile in all areas of coding and Unity in general. Having experience in animations, UI coding, saving & loading gamestates, general gameplay programming and optimization have been extremely helpful on my other projects.
